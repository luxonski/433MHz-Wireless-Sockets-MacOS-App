# 433MHz Wireless Sockets MacOS App

This is a Status Bar App for MacOS, written in Swift 3, for my [433 MHz Wireless Sockets API](https://github.com/philipptrenz/433MHz-Wireless-Sockets-API). Your configured wireless sockets get displayed in a status bar menu, so you can switch them handy without opening your browser or making a curl request.

Look at the *[433 MHz Wireless Sockets API](https://github.com/philipptrenz/433MHz-Wireless-Sockets-API)* for more information!
